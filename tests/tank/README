How can one even think of an open gas tank ...
         well now you can see how models can be flawed.


        I just did it to see how My models cope
with different media. It so happened OpenTank got in the
test model :(. But all is not lost. At least it tested out
valve, Feed and Reservoir models ....


in crux the opengas tank is a crazy construct ...

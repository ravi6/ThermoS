  Now this model is not working since upgrading
to Modelica 4.0.0 ... It thinks that there are
two fewer eqns than variables. Beats me.
Even the OpenTank model case Under Tanks tests
has similar issue. The problem appears to be with
Inlet and Outlet models.

Figured it out. I had to specify pressures at the inlet/output
ports of the SimpleTank. I specified it just for inlet port connections
but not at the outlet port connections. I would have thought these 
should have been implemented through connect statement.

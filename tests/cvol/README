This is a very simple problem to solve. And yet
the DASSL fails unless proper flowThreshold is specified.
What happens is when the flow through the buffer cylinder
almost ceases, the tee mixing equations at the junction 
become ill conditioned especially if prevailing flows are
large in the rest of the problem. And we get crazy gitter in the
solution. Look at the picture. Once the flow threshold is set
to appropriate value (eg just two orders of magnitude les than
normal flow) you get not glitches.


On the other hand, using gastank in series is a lot more easily
handled. I think for my adsorber issues tank in line is a better
approximation to reality, than a buffer (or surge tank)

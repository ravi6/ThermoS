Passing a model into another ...

 Declaring a model as replaceable and assigning
an inital value does not instantiate it. It just
redefines it and assigns the name
         eg.
        replaceable model newmodel = somemodel(some params) ;
at this stage newmodel is only a redefined model 
not instantiated.

If you want to use the model
     newmodel  anew   ;   ... this instantiates newmodel as anew;

but with packaged functions it is different ???
            replaceable package  a_pkg = default_pkg

but then you can begin to use    a_pkg.somefun(x,y,z) without
instantiating ....

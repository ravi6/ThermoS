 Coding errors eliminated ...  12th May
 Segment run fails with 
   Failed to build Model error 

no other error messages ... no results
  What is going on ? No nonlinear solution errors?
 Compilation/Translation shows no errors

Well... after adding "getErrorString()" after
simulation, I got lot more info. There is a booboo
in initial alogorithm. Dimension index was in the
incorrect position. But why did not 
omc pickit up during translation???

LESSON"  stick getErrorString() after simulaiton

Anyway, even after that the translator failed with
COMPILER Error report bug with type mismatch reported
when there is no mismatch.

Tried to make a small sample code to mimic the current
model to see what feature is giving me this bug. The "bug"
directory in misc contains my explorations. So far I am unable
to get the error with similar code structure ... used very simple
connection type of my own.

Discovered bug in flow versus pressure drop expressions in 
valve, heaterCooler and Hx ... (omitted sqrt operator on density)
Co-current config with multi-segment testest. Works well. Needed
to ensure that the flow resistance coef. is scaled appropriately
when excahnger segment length changes. (resistence decreases with
square root of the path lenght... see pipe flow equaiton for clarity)
